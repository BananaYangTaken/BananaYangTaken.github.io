                        While the reader of so-called serious literature will follow public discussions of novels, popular fiction production employs more direct and short-term 
                        marketing strategies by openly declaring a work's genre. 
                        <br /><br />
                        Popular novels are based entirely on the expectations for the particular genre, and this includes the creation of a series of novels with 
                        an identifiable brand name. e.g. the Sherlock Holmes series by Arthur Conan Doyle.
                        <br /><br />
                        Genre literature might be seen as the successor of the early modern chapbook. Both fields share a focus on readers who are in search of accessible 
                        reading satisfaction.

                                    Horror is a genre of speculative fiction which is intended to frighten, scare, or disgust. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon defined the horror story as
                                    "a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks, or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing

                    A major development in this century has been novels published as ebooks, and the growth of web fiction, which is available primarily
                    or solely on the Internet. 
                    <br /><br />
                    A common type is the web serial: unlike most modern novels, web fiction novels are frequently published in parts over time. Ebooks 
                    are often published with a paper version. Audio books (a recording of a book reading) have also become common this century.
                    <br /><br />
                    Another non-traditional format, popular this century, is the graphic novel. However, though a graphic novel may be "a fictional story that 
                    is presented in comic-strip format and published as a book", it can also refers to non-fiction and collections of short works.

                                    Light novels are commonly illustrated in a manga art style, and are often adapted into manga and anime. While most light novels are published 
                                    only as books, some have their chapters first serialized monthly in anthology magazines before being collected and compiled into book format, 
                                    similar to how manga is published.

                                    The term "light novel" is a wasei-eigo, or a Japanese term formed from words in the English language. Light novels are often called ranobe or, in English, LN.

                                    Spoken audio has been available in schools and public libraries and to a lesser extent in music shops since the 1930s. Many spoken word 
                                    albums were made prior to the age of cassettes, compact discs, and downloadable audio, often of poetry and plays rather than books.

                                    An audiobook (or a talking book) is a recording of a book or other work being read out loud. A reading of the complete text is described 
                                    as "unabridged", while readings of shorter versions are abridgements.

                                    Serialisation can also begin with a single short story that is subsequently turned into a series. Historically, such series have been 
                                    published in periodicals. Popular short-story series are often published together in book form as collections.

                        Another non-traditional format, popular this century, is the graphic novel. However, though a graphic novel may be "a fictional story that is presented in
                        comic-strip format and published as a book",it can also refers to non-fiction and collections of short works.
                    <br /><br />
                        While the term graphic novel was coined in the 1960s there were precursors in the 19th century. The author John Updike, when he spoke to the Bristol
                        Literary Society in 1969, on "the death of the novel", declared that he saw "no intrinsic reason why a doubly talented artist might not arise and 
                        create a comic strip novel masterpiece".
