                            <strong>Chivalric romances</strong><br />
                            Romance or chivalric romance is a type of narrative in prose or verse popular in the aristocratic circles of High Medieval and Early Modern Europe.<br />
                            They were marvel-filled adventures, often of a knight-errant with heroic qualities, who undertakes a quest, yet it is "the emphasis on heterosexual
                            love and courtly manners distinguishes it from the chanson de geste and other kinds of epic, which involve heroism."
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>The novella</strong><br />
                            The term "novel" originates from the production of short stories, or novella that remained part of a European oral culture of storytelling into the
                            late 19th century.<br />
                            Fairy tales, jokes, and humorous stories designed to make a point in a conversation, and the exemplum a priest would insert
                            in a sermon belong into this tradition.

                            <strong>15th Century</strong><br />
                            The modern distinction between history and fiction did not exist in the early sixteenth century and the grossest improbabilities pervade many
                            historical accounts found in the early modern print market.
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>Fact or Fiction?</strong><br />
                            William Caxton's 1485 edition of Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur (1471) and Sir John Mandeville's Voyages, written in the 14th century;<br />
                            Both works containing a series of magical incidents and historical improbabilities were viewed as true history.<br />
                            But both works were eventually came to be viewed as works of fiction.
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>Factors of Separation</strong><br />
                            In the 16th and 17th centuries two factors led to the separation of history and fiction. <br />
                            The invention of printing immediately created a new market of comparatively cheap entertainment and knowledge in the form of chapbooks. 
                            known as belles lettres. <br />
                            The second major development was the first best-seller of modern fiction, the Spanish Amadis de Gaula, by García Montalvo.

                            <strong>Philosophical Novel</strong><br />
                            The rising status of the novel in eighteenth century can be seen in the development of philosophical and experimental novels.<br />
                            Philosophical fiction was not exactly new. Plato's dialogues were embedded in fictional narratives and his Republic is an early example of a Utopia.<br />
                            The tradition of works of fiction that were also philosophical texts continued with Thomas More's Utopia (1516) and Tommaso Campanella's
                            City of the Sun (1602).<br /><br />
                            <strong>18th-century Romance genre</strong><br />
                            The rise of the word novel at the cost of its rival, the romance, remained a Spanish and English phenomenon, and though readers all over Western
                            Europe had welcomed the novel(la) or short history as an alternative in the second half of the 17th century, only the English and the Spanish had,
                            however, openly discredited the romance genre.<br /><br />
                            <strong>Changing cultural status</strong><br />
                            By around 1700, fiction was no longer a predominantly aristocratic entertainment, and printed books had soon gained
                            the power to reach readers of almost all classes, though the reading habits differed and to follow fashions remained a privilege.<br /><br />
                            <strong>Acceptance of Novel as Literature</strong><br />
                            The French churchman and scholar Pierre Daniel Huet's Traitté de l'origine des romans (1670) laid the ground for a greater acceptance of the novel as literature,
                            that is comparable to the classics, in the early 18th century.<br />
                            The theologian had not only dared to praise fictions, but he had also explained techniques of theological interpretation of fiction, which was a novelty.<br />
                            Furthermore, readers of novels and romances could gain insight not only into their own culture, but also that of distant, exotic countries<br /><br />

                            <strong>Romanticism</strong><br />
                            The very word romanticism is connected to the idea of romance, and the romance genre experienced a revival, at the end of the 18th century,
                            with gothic fiction. <br />

                            The new romances challenged the idea that the novel involved a realistic depiction of life, and destabilized the difference the critics
                            had been trying to establish, between serious classical art and popular fiction.<br />
                            Gothic romances exploited the grotesque, and some critics thought that their subject matter deserved less credit than the worst medieval tales of Arthurian knighthood.
                            <br />
                            Under such readings, novels were described as exploring deeper human motives, and it was suggested that such artistic freedom would reveal 
                            what had not previously been openly visible.
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>Victorian Period: 1837-1901</strong><br />
                            In the 19th century the relationship between authors, publishers, and readers, changed. <br /> 
                            Authors originally had only received payment for their manuscript, however, changes in copyright laws, which began in 18th and continued
                            into the 19th century promised royalties on all future editions. <br />
                            Another change in the 19th century was that novelists began to read their works in theaters, halls, and bookshops. Also during the nineteenth 
                            century the market for popular fiction grew, and competed with works of literature. <br />
                            New institutions like the circulating library created a new market with a mass reading public. <br />
                            <br /><br />
                            Another difference was that novels began to deal with more difficult subjects, including current political and social issues, that were
                            being discussed in newspapers and magazines. <br />
                            The idea of social responsibility became a key subject, whether of the citizen, or of the artist, with the theoretical debate concentrating 
                            on questions around the moral soundness of the modern novel.<br /><br />
                            Many 19th-century authors dealt with significant social matters. Émile Zola's novels depicted the world of the working classes, which 
                            Marx and Engels's non-fiction explores.<br /> In the United States slavery and racism became topics of far broader public debate thanks to Harriet 
                            Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), which dramatizes topics that had previously been discussed mainly in the abstract.
