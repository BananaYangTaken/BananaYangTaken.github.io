                            A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction, typically written in prose and published as a book. 
                            The present English word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the Italian: novella for "new", "news", or "short story of something new",
                            itself from the Latin: novella, a singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus, diminutive of novus, meaning "new".

                            According to Margaret Doody, the novel has "a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years",
                            with its origins in the Ancient Greek and Roman novel, in Chivalric romance, and in the tradition of the Italian renaissance novella. 
                            <br /><br />
                            The ancient romance form was revived by Romanticism, especially the historical romances of Walter Scott and the Gothic novel. 
                            <br /><br />
                            Some, including M. H. Abrams and Walter Scott, have argued that a novel is a fiction narrative that displays a realistic depiction of the state of a society,
                            while the romance encompasses any fictitious narrative that emphasizes marvellous or uncommon incidents.

                            Murasaki Shikibu's Tale of Genji, an early 11th-century Japanese text, has sometimes been described as the world's first novel based on its
                            early use of the experience of intimacy in a narrative form, — there were certainly long fictional prose works that preceded it. 
                            <br /><br />
                            Spread of printed books in China led to the appearance of classical Chinese novels by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). An early example from Europe was 
                            written in Muslim Spain by the Sufi writer Ibn Tufayl entitled Hayy ibn Yaqdhan. Later developments occurred after the invention of the
                            printing press. 
                            <br /><br />
                            Miguel de Cervantes, author of Don Quixote (the first part of which was published in 1605), is frequently cited as the first
                            significant European novelist of the modern era. Literary historian Ian Watt, in The Rise of the Novel (1957), argued that the modern    
                            novel was born in the early 18th century.

                            Works of fiction that include marvellous or uncommon incidents are also novels, including The Lord of the Rings, To Kill a Mockingbird,
                            and Frankenstein. "Romances" are works of fiction whose main emphasis is on marvellous or unusual incidents, and should not be confused with
                            the romance novel, a type of genre fiction that focuses on romantic love.
                            <br /><br />
                            Recent technological developments have led to many novels also being published in non-print media: this includes audio books, web novels, and ebooks. 
                            <br /><br />
                            Another non-traditional fiction format can be found in some graphic novels. While these comic book versions of works of fiction have their origins
                            in the 19th century, they have only become popular more recently.
